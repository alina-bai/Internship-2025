# Internship Project

This repository contains my internship projects, structured by weeks.  
Each week builds upon the previous one, gradually forming a complete Spring Boot application.

### **#Week 1:**
Environment Setup & Project Initialization
This week focuses on establishing the core development environment and generating the foundational Spring Boot project that will be used throughout the entire development process. The primary goal is to have a fully functional, minimal Spring Boot application running locally, ready for subsequent development phases.
- Created a basic Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.(https://start.spring.io/)
- Implemented a simple REST controller with a "Hello World" endpoint.
- To open in browser:  http://localhost:8080/hello

### **#Week 2:** Version Control, Project Structure, and Initial Database Integration
This week focuses on integrating robust version control, establishing a logical project structure, and laying the groundwork for data persistence with an in-memory database and a foundational entity. The goal is to have the project managed under Git, organized into logical packages, and capable of interacting with a basic database entity.
- .gitignore file was already in my project, just added .env, .gitattributes, .gitignore, pom.xml
- created README.md to describe all the steps week by week.
