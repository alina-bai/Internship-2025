# Internship Project

This repository contains my internship projects, structured by weeks.  
Each week builds upon the previous one, gradually forming a complete Spring Boot application.

### **#Week 1:**
- Created a basic Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.(https://start.spring.io/)
- Implemented a simple REST controller with a "Hello World" endpoint.
- To open in browser:  http://localhost:8080/hello

### **#Week 2:**
- .gitignore file was already in my project, just added .env, .gitattributes, .gitignore, pom.xml
- created README.md to describe all the steps week by week.
